     ----- Linux Get Started -----

---- Before Moving Forward To Our Linux Class I Want You To Understand That Everything In Linus Is FILES ----

1. Write pwd in terminal to get to know where you're means in which directory.
command: pwd
output: /home/user/
pwd stands for - Print Working Directory

2. How you can check files and all stuff present in the current directory
command: ls
output: Desktop    Downloads   Music     Public           snap       Videos
        Documents  msfinstall  Pictures  PycharmProjects  Templates
ls stands for - List

3. How you can go to the directory available in list
#command: cd Desktop
Output: user@Anonymous:~/Desktop$
cd stands for - Change directory

#Now write pwd to see if you're really in the Desktop or not
command: pwd
output: /home/user/Desktop

#Write ls to see which files are available on Desktop
command: ls
output: Linux Basics.txt

4. How to go back from current directory
cuurent directory: /home/user/Desktop
command: cd ..
checking command: pwd
output: /home/user

#Tip
Always check which directory you have access to by writting pwd command & hit Enter

5. How to go back again
cuurent directory: /home/user
command: cd ..
checking command: pwd
output: /home

6. Go back again one time
cuurent directory: /home
command: cd ..
checking command: pwd
output: / ---> This is a root of the file system basically the end

7. How to move forward from any directory
cuurent directory: / ---> Root
command: cd \
checking command: pwd
output: /home/user




##### Linux For Hackers Episode-02 #####
     ----- Linux File System -----

8. Who Am I? Let's find out
command: whoami ---> small letters
output: Username ---> Your name on the system

9. What is bin in root?
Bin stands for Binaries computer speak
command: pwd
output: / ---> root

#Access bin
command: ls
output: bin    dev   lib    libx32      mnt   root  snap      sys  var
boot   etc   lib32  lost+found  opt   run   srv       tmp
cdrom  home  lib64  media       proc  sbin  swapfile  usr

command: cd bin
output: Tons of Commands that you're using right now let's find ls, pwd & whoami etc.

10. How to copy/backup any command?
Reason: We are going to demonstrate this to see if we can make our own command or not.

WARNING!!!
Before making a backup don't delete any command do it on your own.

#Where we are! Let's find out
command: pwd
output: /bin

We're taking ls for demostrating purpose.

Now it's time to copy ls and assign to something our own
What will happen? It will copy the binary contents of ls to your own named command.
command: cp ls newls
#
cp stands for copy
output: cp: cannot create regular file 'newls': Permission denied

## Solution: use sudo before command to provide previleges of Admin we'll discuss "sudo" later in this class

command: sudo cp ls cyber

Write newls and you'll get the same result as ls
command: newls

!!! Now it's time to delete the ls the original one !!!
command: rm ls
rm stands for Remove
output: rm: remove write-protected regular file 'ls'?

You need to answer "Yes" but the best way to write the command is
command: sudo rm ls
command: ls ---> To check the list as we learned recently to show the list
output: bash: /usr/bin/ls: No such file or directory

ls not found why so let's try newls that we assigned from ls
command: newls
ouput: Tons of commands ---> Means it worked

11. How to get back to ls but how? We removed it right
command: sudo cp newls ls
#Now we're copying newls to ls as we did recently
ouput: Tons of commands again
That's good we got the ls again :)

Now it's time to remove newls coz we don't need it right?
command: sudo rm newls
Let's check if newls exists or not

# command: newls
output: bash: /usr/bin/newls: No such file or directory

Good we are done :)

12. Now it's time to go back and check what is sbin
command: pwd
output: /bin
#
command: cd / or cd ..
output: / ---> root

command: ls
output: bin    dev   lib    libx32      mnt   root  snap      sys  var
boot   etc   lib32  lost+found  opt   run   srv       tmp
cdrom  home  lib64  media       proc  sbin  swapfile  usr

Now let's check the sbin means it's a super binaries that can be accessed via admin and it has special commands let's see.
command: cd sbin
ouput: Tons of special commands.

Now let's try some command for demostration like adduser
command: sudo adduser username ---> you can use any name on username like ben or charlie etc.
output: Now it'll ask some detils like password and confirm password etc.

13. How can you check the users?
current directory: / ---> root
command: ls
output: bin    dev   lib    libx32      mnt   root  snap      sys  var
boot   etc   lib32  lost+found  opt   run   srv       tmp
cdrom  home  lib64  media       proc  sbin  swapfile  usr

command: cd home
command: ls
output: Demouser

Let's jump into Demouser and see what's we got :)
command: cd Demouser
command: ls
output: Desktop    Downloads   Music     Public           snap       Videos
Documents  msfinstall  Pictures  PycharmProjects  Templates

14. How we can check the root previleges means who is root?
current directory: / ---> root
command: cd root
output: bash: cd: root: Permission denied

What just happened? Take 2 min to think of the solution!
Yes, I got the solution :)

command: sudo ls root
output: snap
command: ls snap

15. How we can check something cool? Like network configurations right :)
command: pwd
output: / ---> root
#
command: cd etc
output: Tons of commands
Let's find a network yes we got it!

command: sudo cd network
